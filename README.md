# Not a TV (channelsurf)

This project is an interactive web application inspired by the experience of channel surfing on traditional television, but using YouTube videos. It is inspired by NaiveTV, but is based on the YouTube API instead of self-hosted video. The purpose is to simulate channel switching with both visual and audio white noise between videos, evoking the feeling of analog TV.

> Project created with Vue 3 + Vite.
